# Mask or Reconstruct ? 
In this project, we present a comparative analysis between reconstruction based techniques (AutoEncoders and its variants) and masking based techniques (such as BERT) for in-vehicle intrusion detection.


Our comparision is leveraged on both datasets: 


1)ROAD (https://0xsam.com/road/)
2)IVNID (https://ocslab.hksecurity.net/Datasets/datachallenge2019/car)
